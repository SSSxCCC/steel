# Create Project

In this chapter we create our ball game project.

Click the "Project -> Open" button in the top menu of the editor and you can see the "Open Project" dialog. Then click the "Browse" button to select a folder for the ball game project, for example "D:\steel-projects\ball". Finally click the "Open" button in the dialog:

![image](../images/create-project.png)

The project will start compiling. You can see the compilation output from the terminal:

![image](../images/create-project-finish.png)

When you see "Project::compile end", it means that the project has been compiled successfully.
